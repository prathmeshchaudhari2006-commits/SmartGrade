  CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: If evaluating an uploaded handwritten image, check the legibility first. If the handwriting or image is too blurry, messy, or illegible to confidently read more than 80% of the words, YOU MUST STOP GRADING. Do not guess. Instead, return a special JSON response: {"error": "ILLEGIBLE_HANDWRITING", "score": null}.
  
  Otherwise, analyze the student's submission mapping to the GDG Solution Challenge 2025 Technical Approach structure. Provide your response in this exact JSON format (and DO NOT wrap in markdown code blocks like \`\`\`json):
